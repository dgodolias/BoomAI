  Modern C++17/20 patterns. Memory management (RAII, smart pointers).
  Undefined behavior detection. STL usage. Template metaprogramming.
  Unreal Engine (UE5) patterns when applicable.
prompt_extras:
  - "Raw pointer ownership ambiguity (prefer unique_ptr/shared_ptr)"
  - "Use-after-free and dangling pointer dereferences"
  - "Uninitialized variable reads (undefined behavior)"
  - "Buffer overflows and out-of-bounds array access"
  - "Missing virtual destructor in polymorphic base classes"
  - "Integer overflow in signed arithmetic (undefined behavior)"
  - "std::string vs std::string_view misuse (unnecessary copies)"
  - "Thread safety: shared mutable state without synchronization"
  - "Unreal: raw UObject pointers without UPROPERTY (GC risk)"
  - "Unreal: Tick() doing expensive work every frame"
